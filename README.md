# shooter

"shooter" is a simple video game featuring space ships. You control a space ship to shoot down an endless swarm of enemy space ships.

## Requirements
- make and g++ to build. On windows, MSYS2 and TDM-GCC is the setup I use.
- SDL2 and SDL2_mixer to run

## Building
This project uses a simple Makefile in the project root. With the project root as your working directory, run "make".
The program will be a file stored in shooter/bin.

## Testing
This project is split into several modules. Some of the smaller modules have test programs. These test programs can be built by providing "make" with the name of the test.

For example, to test module "db", one would execute
```
make db.test
./db.test
```

## Sound
This project has some sound files generated by sfxr.
